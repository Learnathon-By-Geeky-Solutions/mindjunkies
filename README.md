## Project Description
We are building a Learning Management System (LMS) using Django. Our main goal is to
create a feature-rich platform that can scale as per user increase. During this Learnathon 3.0, we
want to develop and deploy the MVP (Minimum Viable Product). We want to ensure a welldesigned
system for the core functionalities. After completing our MVP, we will adopt CI/CD
(Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment) workflows to integrate future features,
improvements, and optimizations seamlessly.
